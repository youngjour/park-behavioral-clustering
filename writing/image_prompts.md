# Image Prompts for Manuscript Figures

## Figure G_Abstract: Graphical Abstract
**Concept**: A visual summary of the study's flow from big data to policy insight.
**Prompt**:
> A professional, clean isometric diagram illustrating an urban analytics workflow on a white background.
> **Left Side (Input)**: A glowing 3D map of Seoul with dynamic data streams (representing real-time population) flowing into a central prism. The data streams are colored blue and teal.
> **Center (Processing)**: The prism splits the data into distinct, colorful 3D clusters (representing park typologies like "active", "quiet", "tourist").
> **Right Side (Output/Insight)**: A sleek dashboard interface showing a predictive model (XGBoost tree structure) and a prominent insight visual labeled "Structural Inelasticity" - depicted as a rigid concrete urban grid constraining a fluid green organic shape.
> **Style**: High-tech, academic, minimalist, vector-art style, suitable for a scientific journal. Colors: Blue, Green, White, Grey.

## Figure S1: Research Methodology Pipeline
**Concept**: Detailed flowchart of the 4 phases.
**Prompt**:
> A structured flat 2D flowchart diagram.
> **Phase 1**: "Behavioral Profiling" icon (people silhouettes + clock). Arrow to ->
> **Phase 2**: "Variable Engineering" icon (gears + map layers for Transit/Network/Facilities). Arrow to ->
> **Phase 3**: "Predictive Modeling" icon (Decision Tree + Matrix). Text: "XGBoost vs SVM". Arrow to ->
> **Phase 4**: "Diagnostic Insight" icon (Magnifying glass over a park map). Text: "Structural Inelasticity".
> **Style**: Clean corporate infographic style, sans-serif font, muted professional colors (slate blue, sage green).

## Figure S2: XGBoost Model Architecture (Conceptual)
**Concept**: Visualizing how the model prioritizes structural variables.
**Prompt**:
> A conceptual visualization of a Gradient Boosting Machine model.
> Multiple decision trees layered sequentially. The root nodes of the trees are emphasized and labeled with icons representing "Transit" (Subway) and "Network" (Road grid).
> Leaf nodes show icons of different park types (Family, Youth, Senior).
> **Key Visual**: The "Transit" and "Population Density" branches are thick and strong (high importance), while "Internal Facility" branches are thin (low importance).
> **Style**: Data visualization style, clear hierarchy, white background.
